# Background

I am a 3rd year PhD student in the [OPTACIMM Lab](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/optacimm/) at the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University. My undergraduate degree is from the University of Missouri (go Tigers!). My current research focuses on understanding healthcare processes surrounding maternal mortality and looks to improve healthcare quality. I received my MA in Biomedical Informatics in 2024.
